# EBD Express
SQL ORM with Express Templates

## How it works
Edb Express is a simple to-do list that allows users to input a type of burger they would like to eat, save it to the database, and update the database once they have received their order.

## Known issues
* Items are added to the 'Devoured' list in the order they were clicked, but will be listed in numerical order after refreshing the page.
* Once a new item is added, the page will reload once the animation is complete. This can create awkward use cases for a small percentage of users.
* Please report as you discover!
